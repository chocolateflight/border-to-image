# Border-to-Image

üñºÔ∏è **Border-to-Image** is a simple, single-page web app that lets you upload an image, add custom borders (inner or outer), adjust aspect ratios, set border widths in pixels or percentages, use simple or advanced per-side border controls, and download your edited photo at full resolution. It runs entirely in the browser (no server required) and works seamlessly on desktops and mobile devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Upload**: JPG/PNG/BMP/GIF images directly from your device.
- **Inner Border**: Adds a border around the image, increasing canvas size based on the specified width(s). Maintains the image's position relative to the borders (offset correctly in Advanced Mode).
- **Outer Border**: Adds a border while optionally resizing the entire canvas to a new aspect ratio (e.g. 4:3, 1:1). Fills the background color. Image content (including any inner borders) is positioned based on border settings and aspect ratio padding.
- **px / % Width Units**: Define border widths using fixed pixels (`px`) or percentages (`%`) relative to the current image dimensions at the time of application.
- **Simple / Advanced Mode**:
    - Toggle between modes at any time.
    - **Simple Mode**: Set a single, uniform border width applied to all four sides. Image content remains centered within the borders.
    - **Advanced Mode**: Set individual widths for Top, Right, Bottom, and Left. Image positioning respects these asymmetric borders.
- **Live Preview & Undo**:
  - Real-time border preview using sliders, number inputs, and color pickers.
  - **Apply** adds the border operation to history; **Undo** reverses the last operation.
  - **Reset** clears all borders and restores the original uploaded image.
- **Aspect Ratio Presets** (for Outer Border):
  - Landscape & portrait options: 1:1, 4:3/3:4, 3:2/2:3, 5:4/4:5, 16:9/9:16, and keep original.
- **Download**: Choose PNG (lossless) or JPEG (100% quality) format and download at full resolution. Uses Web Share API on compatible devices for direct sharing/saving.
- Fully **responsive** UI that scales images to fit any viewport (desktop or mobile).
